# Spatial positioning

- assume both monophonic (e.g. text) and stereophonic (e.g. field recordings) input
- assume either stereophonic or octophonic output

For simplicity, let's say monophonic input is panned to two channels, and all two
channel signals are distributed across any possible pair of output channels

Then for generating a layer, again for simplicity, let's predetermine the two output
channels (i.e. there is no servo mechanism for adjusting them as we check the constraints,
we can only abort and retry with new settings).

For now, the 'intel' check disregards the relative positions of the foreground and
background, i.e. it is overly protective. (it would be simple to add a channel check
as well)
