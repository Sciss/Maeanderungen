## context

This project was used in our preliminary radio experiment __Raumaneignungen__ (Nayari Castillo, 
Reni Hofmüller, Miriam Raggam, Hanns Holger Rutz). In 2018, we plan to create a radio piece
_generator_, and the code for this will likely be found in this repository as well.
For 'Raumaneignungen', it contains code to translate photographs of cracks in the pavement
to synthetic sounds, which was used as one layer in the piece, as well as an algorithm to
distribute whispered text fragments.

'Raumaneignungen' was part of the Urban Challenges series, and it will eventually be available
from [this archive](https://cba.fro.at/series/urban-challenges).
